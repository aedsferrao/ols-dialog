#summary Short summary of changes for the current build of OLS Dialog. (Note that this may not be the same as the released version.)

----

 * NEW FEATURE: Added a `Search In All Ontologies` option.
 * NEW FEATURE: Disabled the ontology browsing for NEWT (it did not work). Instead a NEWT Species Tip dialog has been added where the most common species can be easily selected.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Updated the help files.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: Ontologies without root terms are now detected and a message is shown when trying to browse such an ontology.
 * BUG FIX: Fixed a problem with using the 'Enter' key to close some of the dialogs (the dialogs reappeared).
 * BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the term hierarchy link was not disabled when a new Term Name or Term ID search was performed.
 * BUG FIX: Disabled column reordering in Term ID search columns. 
 * BUG FIX: Made sure that only one row can be selected at once in the search result tables.
